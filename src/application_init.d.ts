 * A [DI token](guide/glossary#di-token "DI token definition") that you can use to provide

 * The provided functions are injected at application startup and executed during
 * app initialization. If any of these functions returns a Promise or an Observable, initialization
 * does not complete until the Promise is resolved or the Observable is completed.
 *
 * You can, for example, create a factory function that loads language data
 * or an external configuration, and provide that function to the `APP_INITIALIZER` token.
 * The function is executed during the application bootstrap process,
 * and the needed data is available on startup.
