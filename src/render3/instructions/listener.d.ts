/**
* Registers a synthetic host listener (e.g. `(@foo.start)`) on a component.
*
* This instruction is for compatibility purposes and is designed to ensure that a
* synthetic host listener (e.g. `@HostListener('@foo.start')`) properly gets rendered
* in the component's renderer. Normally all host listeners are evaluated with the
* parent component's renderer, but, in the case of animation @triggers, they need
* to be evaluated with the sub component's renderer (because that's where the
* animation triggers are defined).
*
* Do not use this instruction as a replacement for `listener`. This instruction
* only exists to ensure compatibility with the ViewEngine's host binding behavior.
