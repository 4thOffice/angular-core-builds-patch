/**
 * Instruction to distribute projectable nodes among <ng-content> occurrences in a given template.
 * It takes all the selectors from the entire component's template and decides where
 * each projected node belongs (it re-distributes nodes among "buckets" where each "bucket" is
 * backed by a selector).
 *
 * This function requires CSS selectors to be provided in 2 forms: parsed (by a compiler) and text,
 * un-parsed form.
 *
 * The parsed form is needed for efficient matching of a node against a given CSS selector.
 * The un-parsed, textual form is needed for support of the ngProjectAs attribute.
 *
 * Having a CSS selector in 2 different formats is not ideal, but alternatives have even more
 * drawbacks:
 * - having only a textual form would require runtime parsing of CSS selectors;
 * - we can't have only a parsed as we can't re-construct textual form from it (as entered by a
 * template author).
 *
 * @param selectors A collection of parsed CSS selectors
 * @param rawSelectors A collection of CSS selectors in the raw, un-parsed form
