/**
 * Used to apply styling values presently within any map-based bindings on an element.
 *
 * Angular supports map-based styling bindings which can be applied via the
 * `[style]` and `[class]` bindings which can be placed on any HTML element.
 * These bindings can work independently, together or alongside prop-based
 * styling bindings (e.g. `<div [style]="x" [style.width]="w">`).
 *
 * If a map-based styling binding is detected by the compiler, the following
 * AOT code is produced:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * styleMap(ctx.styles); // styles = {key:value}
 * classMap(ctx.classes); // classes = {key:value}|string
 * ```
 *
 * If and when either of the instructions above are evaluated, then the code
 * present in this file is included into the bundle. The mechanism used, to
 * activate support for map-based bindings at runtime is possible via the
 * `activeStylingMapFeature` function (which is also present in this file).
 *
 * # The Algorithm
 * Whenever a map-based binding updates (which is when the identity of the
 * map-value changes) then the map is iterated over and a `StylingMapArray` array
 * is produced. The `StylingMapArray` instance is stored in the binding location
 * where the `BINDING_INDEX` is situated when the `styleMap()` or `classMap()`
 * instruction were called. Once the binding changes, then the internal `bitMask`
 * value is marked as dirty.
 *
 * Styling values are applied once CD exits the element (which happens when
 * the `advance(n)` instruction is called or the template function exits). When
 * this occurs, all prop-based bindings are applied. If a map-based binding is
 * present then a special flushing function (called a sync function) is made
 * available and it will be called each time a styling property is flushed.
 *
 * The flushing algorithm is designed to apply styling for a property (which is
 * a CSS property or a className value) one by one. If map-based bindings
 * are present, then the flushing algorithm will keep calling the maps styling
 * sync function each time a property is visited. This way, the flushing
 * behavior of map-based bindings will always be at the same property level
 * as the current prop-based property being iterated over (because everything
 * is alphabetically sorted).
 *
 * Let's imagine we have the following HTML template code:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div [style]="{width:'100px', height:'200px', 'z-index':'10'}"
 *      [style.width.px]="200">...</div>
 * ```
 *
 * When CD occurs, both the `[style]` and `[style.width]` bindings
 * are evaluated. Then when the styles are flushed on screen, the
 * following operations happen:
 *
 * 1. `[style.width]` is attempted to be written to the element.
 *
 * 2.  Once that happens, the algorithm instructs the map-based
 *     entries (`[style]` in this case) to "catch up" and apply
 *     all values up to the `width` value. When this happens the
 *     `height` value is applied to the element (since it is
 *     alphabetically situated before the `width` property).
 *
 * 3. Since there are no more prop-based entries anymore, the
 *    loop exits and then, just before the flushing ends, it
 *    instructs all map-based bindings to "finish up" applying
 *    their values.
 *
 * 4. The only remaining value within the map-based entries is
 *    the `z-index` value (`width` got skipped because it was
 *    successfully applied via the prop-based `[style.width]`
 *    binding). Since all map-based entries are told to "finish up",
 *    the `z-index` value is iterated over and it is then applied
 *    to the element.
 *
 * The most important thing to take note of here is that prop-based
 * bindings are evaluated in order alongside map-based bindings.
 * This allows all styling across an element to be applied in O(n)
 * time (a similar algorithm is that of the array merge algorithm
 * in merge sort).
